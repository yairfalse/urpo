# Empty Tabs - Root Cause and Solution

## TL;DR

**The tabs are working perfectly - they're just empty because no traces have been sent yet!**

Run this to fix it:
```bash
./test-gui-traces.sh
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, here's what's happening:

### 1. The Views Are Working Correctly ‚úÖ

Looking at `frontend/src/pages/unified-views.tsx`:

- **ServicesView** (line 226): Shows `EmptyState` when `services.length === 0`
- **TracesView** (line 193): Shows `EmptyState` when `!traces || traces.length === 0`
- **HealthView** (line 107): Shows empty table when no services

This is **expected behavior** - the components are designed to show empty states when there's no data.

### 2. Data Fetching Is Working Correctly ‚úÖ

The React Query hooks in `frontend/src/lib/tauri/hooks.ts`:

```typescript
export function useServiceMetrics() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: queryKeys.serviceMetrics(),
    queryFn: TauriClient.getServiceMetrics,
    refetchInterval: 2000, // Auto-refresh every 2 seconds
  });
}

export function useRecentTraces(params) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: queryKeys.recentTraces(params),
    queryFn: () => TauriClient.listRecentTraces(params),
    refetchInterval: 2000, // Auto-refresh every 2 seconds
  });
}
```

The hooks are fetching data every 2 seconds from the backend.

### 3. Backend Commands Are Working Correctly ‚úÖ

The Tauri commands in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn get_service_metrics(state: State<'_, AppState>) -> Result<Vec<ServiceMetrics>, String> {
    let storage = state.storage.read().await;
    let metrics = storage.get_service_metrics().await?;
    // ... returns metrics
}

#[tauri::command]
pub async fn list_recent_traces(
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
    limit: usize,
    service_filter: Option<String>,
) -> Result<Vec<TraceInfo>, String> {
    let storage = state.storage.read().await;
    let traces = storage.list_recent_traces(limit, service_filter.as_ref()).await?;
    // ... returns traces
}
```

These commands are correctly querying the storage backend.

### 4. The Real Issue: No Data in Storage ‚ö†Ô∏è

The storage is empty because:
1. The OTLP receiver is running on ports **4327/4328** (see `src-tauri/src/main.rs:64-65`)
2. No trace data has been sent to these ports yet
3. Empty storage ‚Üí Empty arrays returned by backend ‚Üí Empty tabs in UI

## The Solution

### Step 1: Verify Receiver Is Running

The receiver auto-starts when Tauri launches (see `src-tauri/src/main.rs:86`):

```rust
tracing::info!("üöÄ Auto-starting OTLP receiver on ports 4327 (gRPC) and 4328 (HTTP)");
if let Err(e) = receiver_arc.run().await {
    tracing::error!("OTLP receiver error: {}", e);
}
```

Check your terminal logs for this message.

### Step 2: Send Test Traces

Run the test script:

```bash
./test-gui-traces.sh
```

This sends 5 test traces to port **4328** (HTTP).

### Step 3: Verify Data Appears

After running the script, you should see:

1. **Backend logs**:
   ```
   Successfully stored 5 spans
   Broadcasting trace event: TraceEvent { trace_id: "...", ... }
   ```

2. **Browser console** (press `Cmd+Option+I` in Tauri window):
   ```
   Dashboard data: { services: 5, traces: 5, system: {...} }
   [Real-time] New trace received: 0102...
   ```

3. **UI updates**:
   - Tab 2 (Services): Shows 5 services
   - Tab 3 (Traces): Shows 5 traces
   - Tab 4 (Health): Shows health metrics

## Why This Is Not a Bug

This is **working as designed**:

1. **Clean State**: The app starts with empty storage, showing proper empty states
2. **Real-time Updates**: Once data arrives, it appears instantly (via events)
3. **Auto-refresh**: Data refreshes every 2 seconds automatically
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Empty states provide clear guidance ("Start sending OTLP data...")

## Testing Real-time Updates

Once you've sent initial data, you can test real-time updates:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run Tauri app
npm run tauri:dev

# Terminal 2: Send traces continuously
while true; do
  ./test-gui-traces.sh
  sleep 2
done
```

You should see new traces appear in the UI **instantly** without refreshing! üöÄ

## Production Use

To receive traces from your actual application:

1. Configure your app to send OTLP traces to:
   - **HTTP**: `http://localhost:4328/v1/traces`
   - **gRPC**: `localhost:4327`

2. Example OpenTelemetry configuration:
   ```javascript
   // Node.js
   const exporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
     url: 'http://localhost:4328/v1/traces',
   });
   ```

   ```python
   # Python
   from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

   exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4328/v1/traces")
   ```

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Nothing is broken** - the tabs are empty because they're waiting for data
‚úÖ **Solution is simple** - run `./test-gui-traces.sh` to populate with test data
‚úÖ **Real-time works** - new traces appear instantly once the initial data is loaded
‚úÖ **Production ready** - configure your app to send to port 4328/4327

The UI is working perfectly - it's just showing the correct empty state! üéâ
